# dev

Toying around with deno


# Installation

`deno install -n dev https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thomas-Carlsen/dev/main/main.ts`

You can also call the app whatever you want and have multiple installations of it, by chaning the `name` below.

`deno install -n name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thomas-Carlsen/dev/main/main.ts`.

Personally, I like both `dev` and just `d`.

# Reinstallation

In case of code changes, it is possible to run the following to update the local program:

`deno install -f -r -n d https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Thomas-Carlsen/dev/main/main.ts`

# Uninstallation

`deno uninstall dev` or replace `dev` with whatever you called the program on installtion (see Installation above).

# Usage

Run `dev` or whatever you named program on installation (see Installation above).
